# party-css
CSS to party-parrot-ify your frontend. Use wisely.

On a basal level, this repo has a `ðŸ¦œ` css class which will make whatever html element its applied to 'party-ified'. 

The implementation is pretty simple. It's fundamentally just two animations, a `party` and a `tint`.

```css
.ðŸ¦œ {
  animation: party 0.7s infinite, tint 0.7s infinite;
  transform-origin: bottom center;
}
```

The `tint` animation is responsible for the colour. It was created by manually sampling the [party parrot gif](https://cultofthepartyparrot.com/) at nine eqispaced points. 

`party` on the other hand is responsible for the motion. It is created by `party_skew_gen.py`, which calculates X skew and Y scale components to make a seamless, partyparrot esque monstrosity.

It's not perfect. It could be faster, the X skew could be larger. If you want to improve on this feel free - it's merely parameter turning with the code generation and modifying the animation times.
